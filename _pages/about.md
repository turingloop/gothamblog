I spent two years at Kansas State University majoring in Computer Science and Physics. During that time i worked in Dr. Ruth Weltiâ€™s Lipidomics lab. Currently finishing up my Bachelors in Computer Science(with a minor in math) at Northwest Missouri State University. I am interested in Cyber-Physical Systems, Machine Learning, Multi-Agent Systems, Cybersecurity(especially crypto) and Algorithms. Honestly my interests span a lot of areas and not necessarily limited to Computer Science.

In my free time, I enjoy reading non-fiction.

I also love dogs! Here is Rowdy, he is not mine(but i wish!)

Isn't he cute?!
Anyways, that's about it for now. If you ask me what i want to do with my life, i would say i want to get my PhD and be a scientist. Quite simple right? ðŸ˜‚
