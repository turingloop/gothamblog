I spent two years at Kansas State University majoring in Computer Science and Physics. During that time i worked in Dr. Ruth Welti’s Lipidomics lab. Currently finishing up my Bachelors in Computer Science(with a minor in math) at Northwest Missouri State University. I like Cyber-Physical Systems, Machine Learning, Multi-Agent Systems, Cybersecurity(especially crypto) and Algorithms.

In my free time, I enjoy reading non-fiction and learning some new math or programming language.

I also love dogs! Here is Rowdy, he is not mine(but i wish!)
