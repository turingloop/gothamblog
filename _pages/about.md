I spent two years at Kansas State University majoring in Computer Science and Physics. During that time i worked in Dr. Ruth Weltiâ€™s Lipidomics lab. Currently finishing up my Bachelors in Computer Science(with a minor in math) at Northwest Missouri State University. I am interested in Cyber-Physical Systems, Machine Learning, Multi-Agent Systems, Cybersecurity(especially crypto) and Algorithms. Honestly my interests span a lot of areas and not necessarily limited to Computer Science.

In my free time, I enjoy reading non-fiction. Especially books related to Anthropology(cultural, linguistic, and biological), and History of Science and Mathematics. If i am not reading, i am probably discussing some arcane ideas(atleast for most people) with someone over beer. My current obsessions are Wittgenstein's Tractus Logico-Philosophicus(1921) and Philosophical Investigations(1953). Not gonna lie, his works are quite difficult to understand because he doesn't give a lot of background. But i am trying!

Okay, enough of academic stuff!

Coming to music, although i don't play any instruments(i probably should learn one), I enjoy most kinds of music. My comfort artists/bands are Neil Young, Bob Dylan, Rolling Stones, Led Zeppelin, AC/DC and Tool. But i listen to contemporary pop stuff as well from time to time.

And i love dogs! Here is Rowdy, he is not mine(but i wish!)

Isn't he cute?!
Anyways, that's about it for now. If you ask me what i want to do with my life, i would say i want to get my PhD and be a scientist. Quite simple right? ðŸ˜‚
